Looking at these graphs, we can already see that the women's graph seems pinker than the men's in almost every state, indicating a lower average salary. But this isn't the most easily comparable set of graphs - we need something relative. To that end, we can create a map of the relative wage difference. We calculate the relative wage difference with the percent difference formula:
